# Elevator Simulation Repository

## Data Structures

This repository implements several data structures to manage elevator systems efficiently. Some of the key data structures used include:
- **Queue**
- **Priority Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Array List**

## Getting Started

To get started with the elevator simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ccrawford4/Elevators.git
